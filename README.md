# ECHOFACE
This project develops a real-time facial recognition system using OpenCV for video processing and Dlib for feature extraction and recognition. It detects faces in live feeds, encodes features, and enables accurate recognition across lighting and angles, with applications in security, authentication, and attendance systems.
