# ECHOFACE
This project aims to build a real-time facial recognition system by combining both Dlib
 and OpenCV libraries. OpenCV is used for processing video streams and the Dlib
 library to extract facial features along with recognition. The purpose of the project is to
 detect faces in live feed from a camera then recognize them by initially detecting
 landmarks and encoding faces using a pre-trained model on python for comparison.
 Using machine learning algorithms from Dlib to achieve high levels of accuracy in the
 face detection no matter what conditions it is captured, may be lightning or angle.
 The aim of this project is to illustrate the main stages in an end-to-end facial recognition
 pipeline: face detection, landmarking, feature encoding and comparison. This also
 considers how fast a system can be optimized for real-time processing (speed using
 OpenCV , accuracy with Dlib etc.). The project has many real-world utility applications,
 such as security , interactive sessions with systems without logging in again and out-side
 auto attendance marking systems.
 In summary , this project seeks to provide a robust and ef ficient facial recognition
 solution by leveraging the strengths of both OpenCV and Dlib libraries. By integrating
 real-time video processing with precise facial feature extraction, the system can detect
 and recognize faces even under varying conditions, such as changes in lighting or angle.
 The project demonstrates the end-to-end facial recognition pipeline, from detecting faces
 and identifying landmarks to encoding features for accurate, real-time comparisons.
 With applications in security , seamless authentication, and automated attendance
 tracking, this facial recognition system has the potential to streamline processes that
 require quick and reliable identity verification.
